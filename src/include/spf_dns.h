/**
 * @file
 *
 * This library has the ability to use one or more of any of a number
 * of DNS "layers" to obtain DNS information.  These layers all have
 * compatible APIs, with only minor differences that relate to their
 * specific functions.  So, they can be mixed and matched in any order
 * to do what you want.
 *
 * When you create a new DNS layer, you can (optionally) specify the
 * layer below it.  If the current DNS layer is not able to resolve
 * the query, it will automatically call the lower layer.
 *
 * Some of the DNS layers allow for debugging information to be
 * printed, some do caching, and, of course, some return actual DNS
 * results either by query the network or by looking up the query in a
 * database.
 *
 * For details about each DNS layer, see the appropriate
 * spf_dns_<layer>.h include file.
 *
 *
 * For example, there is a caching DNS layer that saves the compiled
 * SPF records for future use.  While it takes a small amount of time
 * to compile the AOL SPF record, you will more than make up for it by
 * not having to parse the record every time you get a message from
 * AOL.
 * 
 * If you wanted to, you can even run the SPF system without using
 * real DNS lookups at all.  For testing, I used a DNS layer that
 * contained a built-in zone file.  This idea could easily be extended
 * to being able to read the zone file from disk, or to use a database
 * to access information.
 * 
 * One example of what you could do with such a zone file would be to
 * create your own SPF records for the many free-email providers.
 * Depending on whether you layer this local zone file before or after
 * the real DNS lookups, you can either override published SPF
 * records, or you can provide defaults until SPF records are
 * published.
