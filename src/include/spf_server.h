/* It is a bad idea to change this for two reasons.
 *
 * First, the obvious reason is the delays caused on the mail server
 * you are running.  DNS lookups that timeout can be *very* time
 * consuming, and even successful DNS lookups can take 200-500ms.
 * Many MTAs can't afford to wait long and even 2sec is pretty bad.
 *
 * The second, and more important reason, is the SPF records come from
 * a third party which may be malicious.  This third party can direct
 * DNS lookups to be sent to anyone.  If there isn't a limit, then it
 * is easy for someone to create a distributed denial of service
 * attack simply by sending a bunch of emails.  Unlike the delays on
 * your system caused by many DNS lookups, you might not even notice
 * that you are being used as part of a DDoS attack.
