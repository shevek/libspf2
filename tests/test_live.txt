#
# This file is read by test.pl, use "test.pl --help" for details about
# how to run it.  Basically, this file contains options that will be
# passed to the spfquery program and checks to be done on the spfquery
# output.
#
# The format of this file is fairly free-format, but looks can be
# somewhat deceptive.  The parsing done in test.pl is pretty
# simplistic.
#
# Blank lines, and lines beginning with '#' are ignored
#
# The lines all begin with a "command"
#
# default       This sets the default list of options to be included
#               on all spfquery commands.  These options are place
#               first so, in theory, other options can override the
#               defaults.  It is probably a bad idea to use this
#               feature though.
#
# spfquery      This causes the spfquery program to be called with the
#               specified options (along with the default options).
#               The actual name of the spfquery program will be
#               determined by the test.pl program, you can't just
#               change it here.
#
# The following are commands that check the output of the spfquery
# program.
# 
# The first word after command is used to select the SPF
# implementation that this check applies to.  This can either be a
# string, or a regular expression enclosed in slashes.  So, the word
# '/.*/' will match all SPF implementations, while 'perl' will only
# match the implementation named perl.  Strings must be a complete
# match, so 'perl' will not 'perl-extend'.
#
# The rest of the line is also either a literal string or regular
# expression, but unlike the implementation, this can contain spaces.
#
# The order of the output checks is important.  Only the one check
# for each type will be evaluated, so the commands with the most
# general implementation specification should be last.
#
# result        This checks the "SPF result", that is "pass",
#               "unknown", etc.  This is the first line printed by spfquery.
#
# smtp-comment  This checks the explanation string that the MTA can
#               send back if the SPF result fails.  This is the second
#               line printed by spfquery.
#
# header-comment  This checks the comment that should be placed in the
#               Received-SPF: mail header.  This is the third line
#               printed by spfquery.
#               
# received-spf  This is the complete Received-SPF mail header.  It is
#               basically a combination of the SPF result and the
#               header-comment, with a bunch of other stuff thrown
#               in.  Since the information in this line is mostly
#               redundant, at this time, the test.pl does not
#               implement this check.  This is the fourth line printed
#               by spfquery.
